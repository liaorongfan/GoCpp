# CPP Program for Beginners in AIoT

##  Hands on Cpp program
Currently, most practitioners conduct machine learning project with python, however in the scenario of AIoT, python only
is not enough, high performance and hardware friendly program lange is desirable. As I am a typical python coder for computer
vision algorithm R&D, I come to realize that essential works rely on fundamental computing devices such as GPU, CPU, DSP etc.
So I'd like to go with Cpp for Computer Vision / Machine Learning in my spare time and make it open on Git hoping it 
would be helpful for someone else.
